== ROS navigation

=== Navigation stack
Willy uses the ROS navigation stack to navigate indoor. The ROS navigation stack is a complex collection of multiple ROS packages.
These packages read the sensor data we provided from our sensors to create a map of the environment.
When the user provides a goal from rviz, the global planner will provide a path to that goal and calculate the costs in that map.
costs can be compared with obstacles. The bigger the obstacle, the higher the cost.

=== Path calculation
In the image above you can see the overview of the ROS navigation stack in our project. We use the move_base from ROS.
We send goals from rviz or C++ to the move_base. The move_base converts the goal into a path and calculates a route.
This proces is shown below.

=== Autonomous driving
When the path and costs are calculated, the move_base will send geometry::Twist messages to the mobile base.
In our case this is the motorcontroller with the cmd_vel topic.
When the motorcontroller receives a geometry::Twist message, the motor will go driving on the given X, Y and Z velocity from the Twist message.

The ROS navigation stack has a lot of parameters. These parameters change the way the path is calculated and the maximum speed etc.
For more information about these parameters see:
