Preface
-------

The primary interaction method to communicate with ‘Willy’ will be by
voice recognition. When voice recognition is not available an second
communication method is required. Voice recognition may not work well in
a noisy environment. With a second communication method, ‘Willy’ is also
able to communicate to people with speech or hearing problems. In this
document, possible solutions will be researched.

Leap motion sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The leap motion sensor is a 3D motion and gesture controller. The device
contains three infrared LEDs and two infrared cameras. The cameras catch
the reflection of the infrared LEDs at a rate of 200 frames per second.
(Leap Motion, sd) The Leap Motion sensor has an accuracy of 0.7mm.

The Leap Motion could be useful as an alternative for the touchscreen.
Gestures and motion can be detected and with this Willy can be
controlled. The Leap motion is usable without installation.

Kinect Sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kinect V1 is a device which contains an infrared emitter, an
infrared Depth sensor, a color sensor, four microphones and a 3-Axis
accelerometer. (Microsoft, sd) Infrared is used to measure distances to
objects. In combination with the color sensor it creates a RGB image
with depth.

Figure 2: Kinect v1 Sensor

The four microphones can detect sound and even the location of the sound
source and its direction. The 3-Axis accelerometer is used to determine
the orientation of the Kinect sensor.

For interaction Willy could use a Kinect to look for gestures for
controlling Willy.

The benefit of using a Kinect V1 is that it is widely used with other
robots. Because of this Willy could use the Kinect for mapping and
localization as well as secondary interaction with the screen. The
mapping while driving and the interaction when Willy is stationary.

Touch screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A touch screen can be used for controlling Willy. The current screen
Willy uses is a touchscreen but uses way too much power. There are
options which have touch included and use les power, but these are
expensive.

Another option is a bracket which can be applied to a non-touchscreen to
make it touch-sensitive. With this option Willy could use every display
that is on the market with only the added bracket for touch.

Figure 3: Infrared Touch Frame

These touch frames work with infrared to measure the distance to for
example a finger and uses this for its touch input. The touch frame is
connected using USB and works plug and play with only the need of
calibration.

Touch pad
~~~~~~~~~

A touchpad like a laptops touchpad is the easiest and cheapest way to
communicate with Willy. There are versions with a keyboard and mouse in
it. These versions can do everything what an ordinary mouse and keyboard
could do.

Conclusion
----------

The Leap motion is a medium prized alternative for interaction with
Willy. It is easy to understand and can be used without practice.
Because of its fast measurements the Leap is reliable to use as a second
interaction method.

The Kinect V1 is cheap to buy and is already used in other robots for
gesture recognition. A disadvantage of the Kinect is that it requires a
lot of performance from the mini-pc.

The touchscreen or touchscreen infrared frame is an option for precise
tracking of multiple fingers. They are however more expensive than the
other options.

The touchpad is the easiest and most affordable option of them all.
Everyone knows how to use it and it is reliable. It works without
installation when plugged in the USB-port of the mini-pc. Another
benefit is that the touchpad uses the least power of all other options.

The advise is to use a touchpad at this state of the project. Because
this project is all about prototyping, a cheap and reliable alternative
might be the best idea.
